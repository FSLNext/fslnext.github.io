FSL ( Future Starlight Launcher ).Next is a remastered version of FSL.RH.

This version has a more beautiful UI, more user-friendly operations and more features, a better use of the experience.

## Interface Optimize

Except of using modern UI, it also stopped using designer.

This way, there will be no mismatches during maximization. So, maximize is now able.

## Config Files

FSL.Next now imports new config files system.

Config files are archived in "config" folder in FSL's directionry. Includes accounts.fsl and settings.fsl ,

If you want to move data, just copy these files.

You can click save button during you've changed settings, and there's auto-saving in accounts page.

FSL Will always load your config files when launcher start, except if it's missing or broken.

### Multi-Accounts Manage

Now you can manage and create more accounts, but third-party authenticate is now disabled.

You can create account by select a way of authenticate, then do some simple operation to create a account.

- **Offline Authentication:** Type username by the following textbox, then click "create account".
- **Microsoft Authentication:** Click the following button and link your Microsoft account in the browser. If you completed authentication, launcher will process your Minecraft profile, then add to list automaticly. Except of you don't bought Minecraft...

All of these ways supports "Don't save information". This information will only save in this time, and will be deleted when FSL restarted.
