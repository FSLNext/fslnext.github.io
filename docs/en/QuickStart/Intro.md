# FSL.Next Introduction

FSL (Future Starlight Launcher).Next is a reset version of FSL.RH, featuring a more aesthetically pleasing UI, user-friendly operations, additional features, and an improved user experience.

## Interface Optimization

In addition to employing a more modern UI, it has moved away from the designer, with controls written entirely in code by hand. This ensures that there will be no misalignment even at maximum size. Therefore, it is now usable when maximized!

## Configuration Files

FSL.Next introduces a brand-new configuration file system, so you no longer need to reset your settings every time you start up!

The configuration files are stored in the config folder under the FSL root directory, containing two files: accounts.fsl and settings.fsl (accounts and settings). If you need to transfer data, simply copy these two files.

You can change settings and click save, while accounts are saved automatically. You can even choose not to save account information!

Regardless, FSL will load your configuration file upon startup, unless it does not exist or has been corrupted.

### Essential Multi-Account Management for Launchers

You can now set up multiple accounts.

You can add accounts by selecting the verification method and then performing some simple operations.

- **Offline Authentication:** Enter the player's name in the input box below and click add.
- **Microsoft Authentication:** Click the button to open a webpage for verification. After the verification process is complete, the launcher will retrieve your account information and add it automatically. Unless, of course, you have not purchased Minecraft...

Both verification methods support not saving information, which means they will only be saved for the current session and will not be loaded after a restart.

If you are using on a public computer/directory, it is recommended not to save information.

**Please always support the legitimate version of Minecraft!!!**

### Diversified and Well-Organized Settings Interface

The settings interface is now categorized by tabs, which can be divided into tabs such as Launch, Downloads, Personalization, etc., and changes can be made after opening.

The settings are no longer disorganized as before, and they can now be saved.
